# DesignPatters
DESIGN PATTERNS are typical solutions to commonly occuring problems/blueprint.




#Sections that are usually present in a pattern desciption:

-INTENT-of the pattern briefly descibes both the problem and the solution.

-MOTIVATION- further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.

-STRUCTURE-of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.

-CODE EXAMPLE- in one of the popular programming language makes it easier to group the idea behind the pattern.




#Most basic patterns are often called idioms
#Most high-level patterns are architectural patterns



#3 Main Groups of Patterns

1-Creational Pattern-increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

2-Structural Pattern-explains how to assesmble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficiant 

3-Behavioral Pattern-take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.





#ADAPTER

Adapter is also known as: Wrapper

Adapter is a STRUCTUAL design patters that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborat. 

This is a special object that converts the interface of one object to another object so it can understand it.
